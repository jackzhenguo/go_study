### Pre learned

I worked in the company for several years before, developed some commercial software, and used languages such as Python and Java, so when I was learning GO language to develop this project, the process and ideas of developing a software in the past can be applied to the development of this tiny project.

The specific technologies involved, such as control creation, layout, and style adjustment under the fyno framework (a GUI visualization framework of GO language), are similar to those under Python's tkinter and PyQt5. Although the API will be slightly different, the overall UI layout, control creation, and object-oriented development call ideas are the same.
