## Go lanauage introduction
Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It is a statically typed, compiled, concurrent language with syntax similar to C, and has high performance and a simple code structure. It is designed for system programming and cloud computing, and supports a concurrent programming model.

### Advantages

Go has several advantages, including:

- Concurrency: Go has built-in concurrency support, making it easy to create programs that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

- Simplicity: Go has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax and a small set of keywords, making it easy to read and understand code written in Go.

- Performance: Go is designed to be fast, with a low-level memory model that allows for efficient memory usage and a light-weight runtime.

- Scalability: Go is built to scale, making it a good choice for large-scale projects and systems.

- Garbage collection: Go has built-in garbage collection, which automatically handles memory management, reducing the chance of memory leaks and other related issues.

- Cross-platform: Go can be compiled to run on multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux, making it easy to deploy Go programs on different operating systems.

### Disadvantages

Go has some disadvantages that include:

- Limited OOP Support: Go is not an object-oriented language in the traditional sense. It does not have classes or inheritance, which can make it harder to structure large programs.

- No Generics: Go does not have support for generic data types, which can make it harder to write reusable code.

- Limited Standard Library: While the standard library is good for some basic functionality, it is not as extensive as those of other languages such as Python or Java.

- Lack of third-party libraries: Go has a relatively small ecosystem compared to other languages, which means that there are fewer third-party libraries available to use.

No built-in exception handling: Go does not have built-in exception handling, which can make it harder to handle errors and exceptions in the code.

Not good fit for certain domains: Go is not a good fit for certain domains such as GUI development, Data Science, and Machine Learning.

It's worth noting that, despite these disadvantages, Go is still a powerful and efficient language that has a lot to offer, and it's well suited for certain types of projects and use cases.

### Applications

Go is well suited for a variety of applications, including:

- Networking and Systems Programming: Go's built-in concurrency support and low-level memory model make it well suited for networking and systems programming tasks, such as building web servers, proxies, and networking tools.

- Cloud and Distributed Systems: Go's support for concurrency and scalability make it a good choice for building cloud-based services and distributed systems.

- Containerization and Orchestration: Go is the language behind some popular containerization and orchestration tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and etcd.

- Microservices: Go's small runtime and fast performance make it well suited for building microservices, which are small, self-contained services that can be easily deployed and scaled.

- Network Automation: Go has good support for interfacing with network devices, making it a good choice for building network automation tools.

- Game development: Go's support for low-level memory manipulation and cross-compiling capabilities make it a good choice for game development

It's worth noting that Go's capabilities are not limited to these, it can be used in many other fields, it is a versatile and powerful language that can be used for a variety of tasks.



### Go run environment

To create a run environment for Go, you will need to install the Go programming language on your computer. Here are the general steps you can follow:

1. Download the Go installer for your operating system from the official Go website (https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Go. The installer will typically install Go to a location such as /usr/local/go on Linux and macOS or c:\Go on Windows.
3. Once the installation is complete, you'll need to set up some environment variables. For example, on Linux or macOS, you can add the following lines to your shell profile file (such as ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc) to set the GOPATH and PATH environment variables:

```shell
Copy code
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```



### Go hello world

Vim to build a new file: hello_world.go, then at shell window to execute the command: 

```she
go run hello_world.go
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
