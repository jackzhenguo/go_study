### Arrays and slices

Go has arrays and slices which are used to store collections of values.

In Go, an array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.

An array's size is specified when it is declared and cannot be changed afterwards. 

Here's an example of declaring an array of integers:

```
var numbers [5]int
```

In this example, numbers is an array of 5 integers. 

You can also initialize an array with values when it is declared:

```
numbers := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

You can access elements of an array using their index, which starts from 0:

```
fmt.Println("First element:", numbers[0])
fmt.Println("Last element:", numbers[4])
```


A slice, on the other hand, is a dynamic-size collection of elements of the same type. 

Unlike an array, a slice's size can change at runtime. 

Here's an example of declaring a slice of integers:

```
numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

You can also use the `make` function to create a slice:

```
numbers := make([]int, 5)
```

In this example, numbers is a slice of 5 integers with the default value of 0 for each element.



### Maps

Go has maps which are key-value pairs used for efficient lookups.

In Go, a map is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.

A map can be used to store values associated with keys of any type, such as integers, strings, or custom types. 

Here's an example of declaring a map of strings to integers:

```
ages := map[string]int{
    "alice": 25,
    "bob": 30,
    "charlie": 35,
}

```

In this example, ages is a map that associates names of people with their ages.

You can access the value associated with a key using the map indexing operator [key]:

```
age := ages["alice"]
fmt.Println("Age of Alice:", age)
```

You can also use the delete function to remove a key-value pair from a map:

```
delete(ages, "bob")
```

If you need to check whether a key exists in a map, 

you can use a two-value form of indexing and check whether the second value is true:

```
age, exists := ages["bob"]
if exists {
    fmt.Println("Age of Bob:", age)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Bob not found in map")
}
```



### Structs

Go has structs which are user-defined types that allow grouping of values together.

In Go, a struct is a composite data type that groups together zero or more values with different types. 

A struct allows you to define a new custom type that can represent more complex data structures. 

Here's an example of declaring a struct type for a person:

```
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age int
    Address string
}

```

In this example, Person is a struct type with three fields: Name, Age, and Address.

You can create a struct value using a struct literal:

```
person := Person{
    Name: "Alice",
    Age: 25,
    Address: "123 Main St",
}

```

You can access fields of a struct using the dot operator `.`:

```
name := person.Name
fmt.Println("Name:", name)
```

You can also modify the fields of a struct:

```
person.Age = 26
fmt.Println("Age:", person.Age)
```

In this example, the value of the Age field of the person struct is updated to 26.

The above are the most common used grammas and data structures.
